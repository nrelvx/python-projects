# My Flask API
# Flask REST API - Learning Project

> ⚠️ **Note:** I am currently learning Python and Flask.  
> This project was created as part of a learning process by following a tutorial video.  
> I did not write all of the code completely on my own.  

## Project Overview

This is a simple REST API built with **Flask**, **Flask-RESTful**, and **SQLAlchemy**.  
It allows you to:

- GET `/api/users/` — retrieve all users  
- POST `/api/users/` — add a new user (JSON body required)  

There is also a simple home route at `/`.
